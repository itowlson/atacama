# Atacama

_Atacama is the easiest way to get started doing cloud-side WebAssembly functions._

**WARNING:** This is experimental code.
It is not considered production-grade by its developers, neither is it "supported" software.

> DeisLabs is experimenting with many WASM technologies right now.
> This is one of a multitude of projects (including [Krustlet](https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet))
> designed to test the limits of WebAssembly as a cloud-based runtime.

## tl;dr

Atacama allows you to run WebAssembly WASI binaries as event handlers.
Write a "command line" application that takes input and produces output, and compile it to `WASM32-WASI`.
Publish it in a bindle.
Specify a trigger in the Atacama config file.
That's it.

You can use any programming language that can compile to `WASM32-WASI`.
